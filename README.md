# Disertation-Project
The project that I made for my dissertation titled. Action Detection in Untrimmed Videos.

The action_model.py file is a suite with functions that can be used for manipulating the VIRAT dataset

This project uses YOLOv7 "https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7" for the object detection and SORT for object tracking "https://github.com/abewley/sort".
